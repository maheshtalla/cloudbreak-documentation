#### Cluster Summary 

The summary bar includes the following information about your cluster:

| Item | Description |
|---|---|
| Cluster Name | The name that you selected for your cluster is displayed at the top of the page. Below it is the name of the cluster blueprint. |

| Uptime | The amount of time (HH:MM) that the cluster has been in the running state since it was started. Each time you stop and restart the cluster, the running time is reset to 0. |
| Created | The date when the cluster was created. The date format is Mon DD, YYYY. For example: Oct 27, 2017. |

#### Cluster Information 

The following information is available on the cluster details page: 

| Item | Description |

|Hardware | This section includes information about your cluster instances: instance names, instance IDs, instance types, their status, fully qualified domain names (FQDNs), and private and public IPs. |
| Tags | This section lists keys and values of the user-defined tags, in the same order as you added them. |
| Recipes | This section includes recipe-related information. For each recipe, you can see the host group on which a recipe was executed, recipe name, and recipe type. Refer to [Recipes](recipes.md). |
| External Databases | If you are using an external database for your cluster, you can see it here. Refer to [Register an External Database](external-db.md). |
| Repository Details | This section includes Ambari and HDP/HDF repository information, as you provided it in the "Base Images" section when creating a cluster. |
| Image Details | This section includes information about the base image that was used for the Cloudbreak instance. |

#### Event History 

The Event History section shows you events logged for the cluster, with the most recent event at the top. For example, after your cluster has been created, the following messages will be written to the log:

### Accessing Cluster via SSH

If you plan to access the cluster via the command line clients, SSH into the master node instance in the cluster. 

* In order to use SSH, you must generate an SSH key pair or use an existing SSH key pair.  
* You can find the cluster instance public IP addresses on the cluster details page.  
* When accessing instances via SSH use the `cloudbreak` user. 

On Mac OS, you can use the following syntax to SSH to the VM:
<pre>ssh -i "privatekey.pem" cloudbreak@publicIP</pre>
For example:
<pre>ssh -i "dominika-kp.pem" cloudbreak@p52.25.169.132</pre>

On Windows, you can SSH using an SSH client such as PuTTY.

### Access Ambari

You can access Ambari web UI by clicking on the links provided in the **Cluster Information** > **Ambari URL**.

**Steps**

1. From the cluster dashboard, click on the tile representing your cluster to navigate to cluster details.

2. Find the Ambari URL in the **Cluster Information** section. This URL is available once the Ambari cluster creation process has completed.  

3. Click on the **Ambari URL** link.

4. The first time you access the server, your browser will attempt to confirm that the SSL Certificate is valid. Since Cloudbreak automatically generates a self-signed certificate, your browser will warn you about an Untrusted Connection and ask you to confirm a Security Exception. Depending on your browser, perform the steps below to proceed.

    | Browser	| Steps |
|---|---|
| Firefox | Click **Advanced** > Click **Add Exception...** > Click **Confirm Security Exception** |
| Safari	| Click **Continue** |
| Chrome |	Click **Advanced** > Click **Proceed...** |


### Cloudbreak User Accounts

The following table describes what credentials to use to access Cloudbreak and Cloudbreak-managed clusters:

| Component | Method | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Cloudbreak | Web UI, CLI | Access with the username and password provided when launching Cloudbreak on the cloud provider. |
| Cloudbreak | SSH to VM | Access as the "cloudbreak" user with the SSH key provided when launching Cloudbreak on the cloud provider. |
| Cluster | SSH to VMs | Access as the "cloudbreak" user with the SSH key provided during cluster creation. |
| Cluster | Ambari UI |Access with the credentials provided in the “Cluster User” parameter during cluster creation. |
| Cluster | Web UIs for specific cluster services | Access with the credentials provided in the “Cluster User” parameter during cluster creation. |
