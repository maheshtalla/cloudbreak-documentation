## Launching Cloudbreak on Azure

Before launching Cloudbreak on Azure, review and meet the prerequisites. Next, launch Cloudbreak using one of the two available methods. Once Cloudbreak is running, log in to the Cloudbreak UI and create a Cloudbreak credential. 

### Meet the Prerequisites 

Before launching Cloudbreak on Azure, you must meet the following prerequisites.

#### Azure Account 

In order to launch Cloudbreak on the Azure, log in to your existing Microsoft Azure account. If you don't have an account, you can set it up at [https://azure.microsoft.com](https://azure.microsoft.com).

#### Azure Roles 

In order to provision clusters on Azure, Cloudbreak must be able to assume a sufficient Azure role ("Owner" or "Contributor") via Cloudbreak credential: 

* Your account must have the "[Owner](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/role-based-access-built-in-roles#owner)" role (or a role with equivalent permissions) in the subscription in order to [create a Cloudbreak credential](#create-cloudbreak-credential) using the interactive credential method. 

* Your account must have the "[Contributor](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/role-based-access-built-in-roles#contributor)" role (or a role with equivalent permissions) in the subscription in order to [create a Cloudbreak credential](#create-cloudbreak-credential) using the app-based credential method. The role must be assigned to the app that you register in Cloudbreak.

To check the roles in your subscription, log in to your Azure account and navigate to **Subscriptions**.

[Built-in Roles: Contributor](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/role-based-access-built-in-roles#contributor) (External)


#### Azure Region

Decide in which Azure region you would like to launch Cloudbreak. You can launch Cloudbreak and provision your clusters in all regions [supported by Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/regions/). 

Clusters created via Cloudbreak can be in the same or different region as Cloudbreak; when you launch a cluster, you select the region in which to launch it.

[Azure Regions](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/regions/) (External) 


#### SSH Key Pair

When launching Cloudbreak, you will be required to provide your public SSH key. If needed, you can generate a new SSH keypair:

* On MacOS X and Linux using `ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"`  
* On Windows using [PuTTygen](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/ssh-from-windows)


### Launch Cloudbreak 

Launch Cloudbreak deployer using the following steps.

**Steps**

1. Log in to your [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com).

2. Click here to get started with Cloudbreak installation using the Azure Resource Manager template:

    <a href="https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fsequenceiq%2Fazure-cbd-quickstart%2F2.2.0%2FmainTemplate.json" target="_blank"> ![deploy on azure](http://azuredeploy.net/deploybutton.png)</a>
    
3. The template for installing Cloudbreak will appear. On the **Basics** page, provide the following basic parameters:   

    > All parameters except "SmartSense Id" are required. 

    **BASICS**

    | Parameter | Description |
|---|---|

[Filter Network Traffic with Network Security Groups](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-networks-nsg) (External)  


### Explore Newly Created Resources

> This step is optional. 

While the deployment is in progress, you can optionally navigate to the newly created resource group and see what Azure resources are being provisioned.

**Steps**

1. From the left pane, select **Resource groups**.

2. Find the the resource group that you just created and select it to view details.

3. The following resources should have been created in your resource group:

    <a href="../images/azure-resources.png" target="_blank" title="click to enlarge"><img src="../images/azure-resources.png" width="650" title="Azure Portal"></a>
    
    > If you chose to use an existing virtual network, the virtual network will not be added to the resource group. 

    * [Virtual network](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-networks-overview) (VNet) securely connects Azure resources to each other.    
    * [Network security group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-networks-nsg) (NSG) defines inbound and outbound security rules, which control network traffic flow.  
    * [Virtual machine](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/virtual-machines-linux-azure-overview?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-machines%2flinux%2ftoc.json) runs Cloudbreak.   
    * [Public IP address](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-ip-addresses-overview-arm) is assigned to your VM so that it can communicate with other Azure resources.  
    * [Network interface](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-network-interface) (NIC) attached to the VM provides the interconnection between the VM and the underlying software network.    
    * [Blob storage container](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/storage-introduction) is created to store Cloudbreak Deployer OS disk's data.  

4. You can click on each entry to view details of the resource. For example, click on **cbdeployerVM** to view details, including Cloudbreak IP address.

5. Once your deployment is ready, the status will change from "Deploying" to "Success".
    

### Access Cloudbreak UI

Log in to the Cloudbreak UI using the following steps.

**Steps**

1. When your deployment succeeds, you will receive a notification in the top-right corner. You can click on the link provided to navigate to the resource group created earlier.

    > This only works right after deployment. At other times, you can find your resource group by selecting **Resource Groups** from the service menu and then finding your resource group by name.

2. Once you've navigated to your resource group, click on **Deployments** and then click on **Microsoft.Template**:

    <a href="../images/azure-resource-find.png" target="_blank" title="click to enlarge"><img src="../images/azure-resource-find.png" width="650" title="Azure Portal"></a> 

3. From **Outputs**, you can copy the link by clicking on the copy icon:

    <a href="../images/azure-outputs.png" target="_blank" title="click to enlarge"><img src="../images/azure-outputs.png" width="650" title="Azure Portal"></a>   

2. Paste the link in your browser's address bar.

    The first time you access Cloudbreak UI, Cloudbreak will automatically generate a self-signed certificate, due to which your browser will warn you about an untrusted connection and will ask you to confirm a security exception. You can safely proceed to the website. 

    | Browser | Steps |
|---|---|
| Firefox | Click **Advanced** > Click **Add Exception...** > Click **Confirm Security Exception** |
| Safari | Click **Continue** |
| Chrome | Click **Advanced** > Click **Proceed...** |  

3. Now you should be able to access Cloudbreak UI and log in with the **Admin email address** and **Admin password** that you created when launching Cloudbreak:

     <a href="../images/cb-ui.png" target="_blank" title="click to enlarge"><img src="../images/cb-ui.png" width="650" title="Azure Portal"></a>
     
4. Upon a successful login, you are redirected to the dashboard:

    <a href="../images/cb-ui1.png" target="_blank" title="click to enlarge"><img src="../images/cb-ui1.png" width="650" title="Cloudbreak web UI"></a>  

The last task that you need to perform before you can use Cloudbreak is to [create a cloudbreak credential](#create-cloudbreak-credential).         


### Create Cloudbreak Credential

Before you can start creating clusters, you must first create a [Cloudbreak credential](architecture.md#cloudbreak-credential). Without this credential, you will not be able to create clusters via Cloudbreak. Cloudbreak works by connecting your Azure account through this credential, and then uses it to create resources on your behalf.

There are two methods for creating a Cloudbreak credential:


| Method | Description | Prerequisite | Steps |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Interactive** | The advantage of using this method is that the app and service principal creation and role assignment are fully automated, so the only input that you need to provide is the Subscription ID and Directory ID. During the interactive credential creation, you are required to log in to your Azure account. | (1) Your account must have the "Owner" role (or its equivalent) in the subscription. (2) You must be able log in to your Azure account. | To configure an interactive credential, refer to [Create an Interactive Credential](#create-an-interactive-credential). | 
| **App-based** | The advantage of the app-based credential creation is that it allows you to create a credential without logging in to the Azure account, as long as you have been given all the information. In addition to providing your Subscription ID and  Directory ID, you must provide information for your previously created Azure AD application (its ID and key which allows access to it). | (1) Your account must have the "Contributor" role (or equivalent) in the subscription. (2) You or your Azure administrator must perform prerequisite steps of registering an Azure application and assigning the  "Contributor" role to it. This step typically requires admin permissions so you may have to contact your Azure administrator. | To configure an app based credential, refer to [Create an App Based Credential](#create-an-app-based-credential). | 


#### Create an Interactive Credential

Follow these steps to create an interactive Cloudbreak credential.

**Steps**

1. In the Cloudbreak web UI, select **Credentials** from the navigation pane. 

2. Click **Create Credential**. 

3. Under **Cloud provider**, select "Microsoft Azure". 
    
4. Select **Interactive Login**:

5. Provide the following information:

    | Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
| Name | Enter a name for your credential. |
| Description | (Optional) Enter a description. |
| Subscription Id | Copy and paste the Subscription ID from your **Subscriptions**. |
| Tenant Id | Copy and paste your Directory ID from your **Active Directory** > **Properties**. |
| Azure role type | <p>You have the following options:<ul><li>"Use existing Contributor role" (default): If you select this option, Cloudbreak will use the "[Contributor](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/role-based-access-built-in-roles#contributor)" role to create resources. This requires no further input.</li><li>"Reuse existing custom role": If you select this option and enter the name of an existing role, Cloudbreak will use this role to create resources.</li><li>"Let Cloudbreak create a custom role": If you select this option and enter a name for the new role, the role will be created. When choosing role name, make sure that there is no existing role with the name chosen. For information on creating custom roles, refer to [Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/role-based-access-control-custom-roles) documentation. </li></ul></p><p>If using a custom role, make sure that it includes the necessary Action set for Cloudbreak to be able to manage clusters: `Microsoft.Compute/*`, `Microsoft.Network/*`, `Microsoft.Storage/*`, `Microsoft.Resources/*`.</p> |

    To obtain the **Subscription Id**: 
    
     <a href="../images/azure-cred-subscription.png" target="_blank" title="click to enlarge"><img src="../images/azure-cred-subscription.png" width="650" title="Cloudbreak web UI"></a>
