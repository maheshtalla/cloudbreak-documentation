## Installing Cloudbreak on your own VM

This is an advanced deployment option. Select this option if you have custom VM requirements. Otherwise, you should use one of the pre-built images and follow these instructions:

* [Launch on AWS](aws-launch.md)  
* [Launch on Azure](azure-launch.md)  
* [Launch on GCP](gcp-launch.md)  
* [Launch on OpenStack](os-launch.md)   

### System requirements

To launch the Cloudbreak deployer and install the Cloudbreak application, your system must meet the following requirements:

* Minimum VM requirements: 16GB RAM, 40GB disk, 4 cores
* Supported operating systems: RHEL, CentOS, and Oracle Linux 7 (64-bit)
* Docker 1.9.1 must be installed

> You can install Cloudbreak on Mac OS X for evaluation purposes only. Mac OS X is not supported for a production deployment of Cloudbreak.


### Prerequisites

To launch the Cloudbreak deployer and install the Cloudbreak application, you must first meet the following prerequisites:

#### Ports

Ports 22 (SSH), 80 (HTTPS), and 443 (HTTPS) must be open.

#### Root access

Every command must be executed as root. In order to get root privileges execute:

<pre>sudo -i</pre>

#### System updates

Ensure that your system is up-to-date by executing:

<pre>yum -y update</pre>

Reboot it if necessary.

#### Iptables

Install iptables-services:

<pre>yum -y install iptables-services net-tools</pre>

Without iptables-services installed the `iptables save` command will not be available.

Next, configure permissive iptables on your machine:

<pre>
iptables --flush INPUT && \
iptables --flush FORWARD && \
service iptables save
</pre>

Additionally, review the following prerequisites:

* [Prerequisites on AWS](aws-launch.md#meet-the-prerequisites)
* [Prerequisites on Azure](azure-launch.md#meet-the-prerequisites)
* [Prerequisites on GCP](gcp-launch.md#meet-the-prerequisites)
* [Prerequisites on OpenStack](os-launch.md#meet-the-prerequisites)


### Install Cloudbreak on your own VM

Install Cloudbreak using the following steps.

{!docs/common/about-tp.md!}


**Steps**

1. Install the Cloudbreak deployer and unzip the platform-specific single binary to your PATH. For example:

    <pre>yum -y install unzip tar
curl -Ls public-repo-1.hortonworks.com/HDP/cloudbreak/cloudbreak-deployer_2.6.1-rc.10_$(uname)_x86_64.tgz | sudo tar -xz -C /bin cbd
cbd --version</pre>


    Once the Cloudbreak deployer is installed, you can set up the Cloudbreak application.

2. Create a Cloudbreak deployment directory and navigate to it:

    <pre>mkdir cloudbreak-deployment
cd cloudbreak-deployment</pre>

3. In the directory, create a file called `Profile` with the following content:

    <pre>export UAA_DEFAULT_SECRET=MY-SECRET
export UAA_DEFAULT_USER_PW=MY-PASSWORD
export UAA_DEFAULT_USER_EMAIL=MY-EMAIL</pre>

    For example:

    <pre>export UAA_DEFAULT_SECRET=MySecret123
export UAA_DEFAULT_USER_PW=MySecurePassword123
export UAA_DEFAULT_USER_EMAIL=dbialek@hortonworks.com</pre>

    > You will need to provide the email and password when logging in to the Cloudbreak web UI and when using the Cloudbreak CLI. The secret will be used by Cloudbreak for authentication.

4. Generate configurations by executing:

    <pre>rm *.yml
cbd generate</pre>   

    The cbd start command includes the cbd generate command which applies the following steps:

    * Creates the `docker-compose.yml` file, which describes the configuration of all the Docker containers required for the Cloudbreak deployment.  
    * Creates the `uaa.yml` file, which holds the configuration of the identity server used to authenticate users with Cloudbreak.   

5. Start the Cloudbreak application by using the following commands:

    <pre>cbd pull
cbd start</pre>

    This will start the Docker containers and initialize the application. The first time you start the Cloudbreak app, the process will take longer than usual due to the download of all the necessary docker images.

5. Next, check Cloudbreak application logs:

    <pre>cbd logs cloudbreak</pre>

    You should see a message like this in the log: `Started CloudbreakApplication in 36.823 seconds.` Cloudbreak normally takes less than a minute to start.

### Next steps after installing on your own VM

Log in to the Cloudbreak web UI and create a credential for Cloudbreak using the following platform-specific instructions:

* [Access Cloudbreak web UI on AWS](aws-launch.md#access-cloudbreak-web-ui)  
* [Access Cloudbreak web UI on Azure](azure-launch.md#access-cloudbreak-web-ui)  
* [Access Cloudbreak web UI on GCP](gcp-launch.md#access-cloudbreak-web-ui)  
* [Access Cloudbreak web UI on OpenStack](os-launch.md#access-cloudbreak-web-ui)
