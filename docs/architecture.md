## Architecture  

**Cloudbreak deployer** installs Cloudbreak components on a VM. Once these components are deployed, you can use **Cloudbreak application** or Cloudbreak CLI to create, manage, and monitor clusters. 

### Cloudbreak Deployer Architecture

**Cloudbreak deployer** installs Cloudbreak components on a VM. It includes the following components:

| Component | Description |
|---|---|
| **Cloudbreak Application** | Cloudbreak application is built on the foundation of cloud provider APIs and Apache Ambari. | 
| **Uluwatu** | This is Cloudbreak web UI, which can be used to create, manage, and monitor clusters. |
| **Cloudbreak CLI** | This is Cloudbreak's command line tool, which can be used to create, manage, and monitor clusters. | 
| **Identity** | This is Cloudbreak's OAuth identity server implementation, which utilizes UAA. |
| **Sultans** | This is Cloudbreak's user management system. | 
| **Periscope** | This is Cloudbreak's autoscaling application, which is responsible for automatically increasing or decreasing the capacity of the cluster when your pre-defined conditions are met. |
 

### Cloudbreak Application Architecture 

The Cloudbreak application is a web application which simplifies HDP cluster provisioning in the cloud. Based on your input, Cloudbreak provisions all required cloud infrastructure and then provisions an HDP cluster on your behalf within your cloud provider account.

Cloudbreak application is built on the foundation of cloud provider APIs and Apache Ambari:
    
* Cloudbreak uses **cloud provider APIs** to communicate with the cloud providers. 

* Cloudbreak uses the **Cloudbreak credential** to authenticate with your cloud provider account and provision cloud resources required for the HDP clusters. 
    
* Cloudbreak uses Apache Ambari and **Ambari blueprints** to provision, manage, and monitor HDP clusters. Ambari blueprints are a declarative definition of a cluster. With a blueprint, you can specify stack, component layout, and configurations to materialize an HDP cluster instance via Ambari REST API, without having to use the Ambari cluster install wizard.     
    


#### Cloudbreak Credential

After launching Cloudbreak, you must create a Cloudbreak credential for each cloud provider on which you would like to provision clusters. Only after you have completed that step you can start creating clusters. 

Cloudbreak credential allows Cloudbreak to authenticate with the cloud provider and create resources on your behalf. The authentication process varies depending on the cloud provider, but is typically done via assigning a specific IAM role to Cloudbreak which allows Cloudbreak to perform certain actions within your cloud provider account.

#### Ambari Blueprints

Ambari blueprints are a declarative definition of a cluster. A blueprint allows you to specify stack, component layout, and configurations to materialize an HDP cluster instance via Ambari REST API, without having to use the Ambari cluster install wizard.  

Ambari blueprints are specified in JSON format. After you provide the blueprint to Cloudbreak, the host groups in the JSON are mapped to a set of instances when starting the cluster, and the specified services and components are installed on the corresponding nodes.

Cloudbreak includes a few default blueprints and allows you to upload your own blueprints.
